## What I am Trying to Accomplish
In this project, I want to find how strongly speed affects the offensive ability of a player. Although stolen bases can be one way to improve offensive ability with speed, I want to focus on how they can get more hits.

## How I can do this
I am doing this by using stats from [baseballsavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com), which tracks the sprint speed of players, how hard they hit the ball, and what their actual batting average is. I can use this data to figure out which players are getting more hits than they should based on how hard they hit the ball and as a result are improving their offensive ability due to their speed.
